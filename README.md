# Simple Web Assessment

This assessment is designed to gauge your understanding of core web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) before diving into React. Please complete the following tasks to demonstrate your skills.

## Instructions

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Complete the tasks described below in the corresponding files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
4. **Commit** your changes.
5. **Push** your changes to your forked repository.
6. **Submit** the link of your repository to this form https://forms.gle/j49VWsR5gzwFbV6LA.

## Tasks

### HTML (`index.html`)

1. **Structure:** Create the basic structure of a webpage (header, main content area, footer).
2. **Content:** Add the following elements:
   - A heading with your name.
   - A paragraph introducing yourself.
   - An unordered list of your favorite hobbies or interests.
   - An image (can be a placeholder).
   - A button.

### CSS (`style.css`)

1. **Styling:** Apply styles to the elements in your HTML:
   - Choose a color scheme and font for your page.
   - Style the heading, paragraph, list, image, and button.
   - Arrange the elements using layouts (flexbox or grid are recommended).
   - Add some hover effects to the button.

### JavaScript (`script.js`)

1. **Interaction:** Add JavaScript to make your page interactive:
   - When the button is clicked:
     - Change the text content of the paragraph.
     - Toggle a class on the image to change its appearance (e.g., add a border).
     - Change the background color of the page.
   - (Optional) Add more advanced interactions if you'd like (e.g., form validation, dynamically adding list items).

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following:

- **Functionality:** Does the code work as expected?
- **Structure:** Is the HTML well-organized and semantic?
- **Styling:** Does the CSS create a visually appealing and responsive design?
- **JavaScript:** Is the JavaScript code clean, efficient, and does it handle user interactions appropriately?
- **Creativity:** Did you add any personal touches or extra features to make your page unique?
